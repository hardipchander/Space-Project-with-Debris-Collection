# Space-Project-with-Bots
In this project I cleared out all the debris on the Space Map using my Robots.
The Space Map is a 2d grid and the Bots are all numbered when seen on the Space Map.
The goal of this project is to clear all the debris on the Space Map with the Robots as fast as possible. 
In the file bot.cpp I programmed the Robots and how they act. When the program is running and the space map is shown the blue squares are the debris and the numbers are the Robots.

How to run the program on the Terminal with g++ compiler 
step 1 : type make
step 2:  type ./mission or to test the code type ./mission numberofRows numberOfColums #ofBots debrisDensity probabilityofRobotMalfunction
